# Re-building the Effiel Tower

#### Before Building
Before designing the Eiffel Tower I first learnt how to use Geomags, as I was not familiar with them. Luckily the Youtube servers were still running, I watched many Geomags video to familiarise myself on how they work.

Once I learnt how Geomags worked I then researched the blueprints of the tower

#### Blueprints
Luckily, the blueprints were not destroyed in the blast, they were stored in an underground bunker.

After working out the dimensions, I had realised that the Eiffel Tower is considerably smaller than other buildings. Instead of building the tower to the original blueprints, I decided to make the tower bigger, specifically increasing the height by 1.17 times. The new blueprints made the tower 1151ft tall making it taller than any building in the United Kingdom.

#### Builing the New Taller Tower
To the build the tower I focused on two main building blocks a simple cuboid and a Parallelepiped. The straight parts of the towers were built out of the cuboids whereas the angled parts were built with the parallelepipeds.

#### The Crown
For the top of the tower I decided to take some artisitc liberity, making it a hexagonal ball approxamilty 20 metres wide and tall. 

#### Total
Legs + First-Platform + Second-Platform + Third-Platform + Crown = Total

68177906 + 17375036 + (15150646 +5056528) +83162353 + 80345 = Total

**Total = 189002814 (one hundred eighty-nine million, two thousand, eight hundred fourteen) bars and balls**
