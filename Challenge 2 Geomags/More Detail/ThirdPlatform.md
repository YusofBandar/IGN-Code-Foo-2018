# Third Platform

To maintain the simple design, the third platform differs slightly from the original blueprints. The original Eiffel Tower leans in very slightly, instead I decided to keep the third platform straight. 
To accommodate for the very top of the tower I took 20 metres of the third platforms height making it 164 metres tall.
