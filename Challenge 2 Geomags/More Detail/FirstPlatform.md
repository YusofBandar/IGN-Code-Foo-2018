# First Platform

The first part I worked on was the legs for the tower. Initially I calculated the width and height of each leg, as well as the angle. I assumed the straight top of the platform was 10 metres making each leg 56 metres tall. Additionally, I assumed the legs leaned by 30 metres.  

For the legs I wanted the design to be simple, utilising minimal Geomags, yet still resembling the appearance of the old tower, below is the final design.

To work out the total number of bars and balls for the four legs, I worked the total volume for one leg, because one parallelepiped 17 bars and balls, I multiplied the total volume by 22.

As I mentioned earlier I assumed the top part of the platform is 10 metres tall, continuing the simple design the top part is made from cuboids.
