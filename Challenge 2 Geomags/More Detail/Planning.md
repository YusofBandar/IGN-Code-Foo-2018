# Planning

Before designing the Eiffel Tower, I first researched the dimensions of the tower. Luckily, the blueprints were not destroyed in the blast. Figure 1 shows the actual dimensions of the Eiffel Tower.

After working out the dimensions, I had realised that the Eiffel Tower is considerably smaller than other buildings. Instead of building the tower to the original blueprints, I decided to make the tower bigger, specifically increasing the height by 1.17 times. The new blueprints made the tower 1151ft tall making it taller than any building in the United Kingdom.
