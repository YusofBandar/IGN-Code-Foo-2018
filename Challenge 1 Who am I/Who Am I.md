# Who am I?

Hi IGN,
My name is Yusof Bandar and I am 2nd Year Computer Science Student currently living in Manchester United Kingdom. Throughout my degree and in my own time I have learnt many aspects of Computer Science, learning many programming languages, such as Java, Javascript, C and C#, as well as studying data structures and algorithmic design. After I graduate I hope to land a job in software engineering hopefully revolving around video games. My dream job would be to develop VR experiences similar to ILMxLab experiences.

When I am not programming or studying, I love to board game. I am part of a board gaming group where we play on a bi-weekly basis, one my favourite board game is Dead of Winter, I really enjoy co-operative board games but love how Dead of Winter throws a traitor in the mix.  Furthermore, I have attended many hackathons, I have built video games is unity to help people visualise 3D space to building an Alexa App, allowing user to play a RPG game using their voice. I implemented a neural network, within the RPG, to change the game depending on how users play.

The reasons I think you should pick me to participate in IGN's Code Foo Is because of my true passion for programming and computer science, as well as attending many hackathons I volunteered to help a local company to build a system. I have always watched/read IGN reviews on both video games and movies, enjoying how you concisely pack all the information into one video. Additionally, I loved to listen to the IGN UK podcast, which has been sadly cancelled.

I thank you for looking at my IGN Foo application.
